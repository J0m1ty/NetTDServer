# NetTDServer
NetTD is a Unity multiplayer tower defence game, made with hexagons in mind. This is part of a research and development project for my CSC 246 class.

This is the server code, the Unity C# client is over at [NetTD](). This project is also on [itch.io]().

# Rebuilding
Install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file using npm. Run node index.js to start the server. Make sure port 3000 is open and the firewall isn't blocking it.
